# Webpack_restaurant

Simple restaurant page made dinamically with JS and webpack.

Things I learned:

I. The main workflow of webpack

II. How to import and export modules.

III. Create an entire website dinamically

IV. A few more terminal commands in Linux (like npx webpack and generating the node_modules directory)

V. How to make a subtree push from git
